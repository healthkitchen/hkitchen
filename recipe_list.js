        name:"Pasta with Blistered Cherry Tomato Sauce",
        imgsrc:"images/PastawithBlisteredCherryTomatoSauce.jpg",
        ingredients:["1 pound (450g) dry pasta",
        "Kosher salt",
        "4 medium cloves garlic, thinly sliced",
        "6 tablespoons (90ml) extra-virgin olive oil, divided",
        "1 1/2 pounds cherry tomatoes (about 2 pints; 750g)",
        "1 ounce fresh basil leaves, roughly chopped (about 1 cup; 30g)",
        "Freshly ground black pepper",
        "Parmesan cheese, for serving"],
        directions:[
            "Place pasta in a large skillet or saut√© pan and cover with water and a big pinch of salt. Bring to a boil over high heat, stirring occasionally. Boil until just shy of al dente, about 1 minute less than the package instructions recommend.",
            "Meanwhile, heat garlic and 4 tablespoons (60ml) olive oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium heat, stirring frequently, until garlic is softened but not browned, about 3 minutes. Add tomatoes and cook, stirring, until tomatoes begin to burst. You can help them along by pressing on them with the back of a wooden spoon as they soften.",
            "Continue to cook until sauce is rich and creamy, about 5 minutes longer. Stir in basil and season to taste with salt and pepper.",
            "When pasta is cooked, drain, reserving 1 cup (240ml) pasta water. Add pasta to sauce and increase heat to medium-high. Cook, stirring and tossing constantly and adding reserved pasta water as necessary to adjust consistency to a nice, creamy flow. Remove from heat, stir in remaining 2 tablespoons (30ml) olive oil, and grate in a generous shower of Parmesan cheese. Serve immediately, passing extra Parmesan at the table."
