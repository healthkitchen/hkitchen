            ["Kosher salt","Kosher Salt"],
            ["4 medium cloves garlic, thinly sliced",'Garlic'],
            ["6 tablespoons (90ml) extra-virgin olive oil, divided",'Olive Oil'],
            ["1 1/2 pounds cherry tomatoes (about 2 pints; 750g)",'Cherry Tomatoes'],
            ["1 ounce fresh basil leaves, roughly chopped (about 1 cup; 30g)",'Basil'],
            ["Freshly ground black pepper",'Black Pepper'],
            ["Parmesan cheese, for serving",'Parmesan Cheese'],

        directions:[
            "Place pasta in a large skillet or sauté pan and cover with water and a big pinch of salt. Bring to a boil over high heat, stirring occasionally. Boil until just shy of al dente, about 1 minute less than the package instructions recommend.",
            "Meanwhile, heat garlic and 4 tablespoons (60ml) olive oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium heat, stirring frequently, until garlic is softened but not browned, about 3 minutes. Add tomatoes and cook, stirring, until tomatoes begin to burst. You can help them along by pressing on them with the back of a wooden spoon as they soften.",
            "Continue to cook until sauce is rich and creamy, about 5 minutes longer. Stir in basil and season to taste with salt and pepper.",
            "When pasta is cooked, drain, reserving 1 cup (240ml) pasta water. Add pasta to sauce and increase heat to medium-high. Cook, stirring and tossing constantly and adding reserved pasta water as necessary to adjust consistency to a nice, creamy flow. Remove from heat, stir in remaining 2 tablespoons (30ml) olive oil, and grate in a generous shower of Parmesan cheese. Serve immediately, passing extra Parmesan at the table."

        ingredients:[
            ["1 cup all-purpose flour", "Flour"],
            ["1 1/2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breasts, thighs, or tenders", "Chicken"],
            ["Salt", "Salt"],
            ["Freshly ground lack pepper", "Black Pepper"],
            ["2 tablespoons olive oil", "Olive Oil"],
            ["3 tablespoons butter", "Butter"],
            ["1/2 cup dry white wine", "White Wine"],
            ["1/2 cup water, chicken stock, or vegetable stock", "Chicken Stock"],
            ["1/4 cup chopped fresh parlsey leaves, plus 2 tablesppoons for garnish", "Parsley"],
            ["1 lemon, quartered", "Lemon"],
        ],
        directions:[
            "Heat the oven to 200°F. Put the flour on a plate or in a shallow bowl next to the stove. If necessary, put each cutlet between 2 sheets of sheet of plastic wrap and pound to uniform thickness; blot the chicken dry with a paper towel and sprinkle with salt and pepper.",
            "Put the oil and 2 tablespoons of the butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. When the butter has melted, turn a piece of the chicken in the flour to coat it on all sides; shake off any excess. Add the floured chicken to the pan, then repeat with the next piece; work in batches if necessary to avoid crowding the pan.",
            "Cook, adjusting the heat as needed so that the fat is always bubbling but the chicken doesn’t burn. After 2 minutes, rotate the chicken so that the outside edges are moved toward the center and vice versa (don’t flip them; you want the same side in contact with the fat). When the bottom of each piece is brown, after 3 to 4 minutes, turn them over.",
            "Cook on the second side, adjusting the heat as described in Step 3, until the chicken is firm to the touch but still a bit pink inside, another 3 to 4 minutes. To check for doneness, cut into a piece with a thin-bladed knife and take a peek. Transfer the chicken to an ovenproof platter and put it in the oven.",
            "Add the wine to the skillet, keeping the heat at medium-high. Let it bubble away as you stir and scrape the bottom of the pan, until about half the wine has evaporated, a minute or two. Pour in the water and continue to stir until the liquid has thickened slightly and reduced to 1/4 cup, another 2 or 3 minutes. Add the remaining tablespoon of butter to the skillet and swirl the pan around until the butter melts; turn off the heat.",
            "Remove the chicken from the oven, and if any juices have accumulated on the platter, add them to the skillet along with the  1/4 cup parsley. Stir, taste the sauce, and adjust the seasoning. Spoon the sauce over the chicken, garnish with the remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and serve with the lemon quarters."
